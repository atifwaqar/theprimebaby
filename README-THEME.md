# Theme Skin Applied

We imported parts of your purchased theme to style the static shop:

- Pulled **top CSS files** from your zip into `assets/theme/css/` and linked them in all pages.
- Auto-detected **primary font** → `Inter` and **brand color** → `#0289c9`.
- Updated CSS variables in `css/styles.css` to match theme colors and typography.
- Set your logo in header from the theme assets.

> For a perfect pixel-match, next step is to port specific header/footer and component markup from the theme’s Liquid/WordPress templates into these static pages. This skin should already look close in colors, font, and general feel.
